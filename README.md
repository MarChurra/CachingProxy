# CachingProxy
A proxy acting as a CDN that receives requests and caches the responses

caching-proxy --port <number> --origin <url>
--port is the port on which the caching proxy server will run.
--origin is the URL of the server to which the requests will be forwarded.
For example, if the user runs the following command:

caching-proxy --port 3000 --origin http://dummyjson.com
The caching proxy server should start on port 3000 and forward requests to http://dummyjson.com.

Taking the above example, if the user makes a request to http://localhost:3000/products, the caching proxy server should forward the request to http://dummyjson.com/products, return the response along with headers and cache the response. Also, add the headers to the response that indicate whether the response is from the cache or the server.

# If the response is from the cache
X-Cache: HIT

# If the response is from the origin server
X-Cache: MISS
If the same request is made again, the caching proxy server should return the cached response instead of forwarding the request to the server.

You should also provide a way to clear the cache by running a command like following:

caching-proxy --clear-cache
